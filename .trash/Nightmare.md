### Key Differences Between Software Development Models

| Aspect/Model       | Agile                                    | Waterfall                             | Iterative Waterfall                       | Iterative                              | V-Model                                | Incremental Model                       | Prototype Model                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**          | Iterative, flexible development          | Sequential phases with defined stages | Sequential but allows feedback loops      | Repeated cycles of development         | Sequential with testing at each stage  | Incremental builds adding functionality  | Early creation of a working prototype    |
| **Process**        | Sprints/iterations with continuous feedback | Linear sequence of phases             | Linear with feedback and revisions        | Cycles of planning, design, implementation, and testing | Development and testing simultaneously | Divides project into smaller builds      | Develop a prototype, gather feedback, refine requirements |
| **Customer Involvement** | High, continuous feedback              | Low, mainly at beginning and end      | Moderate, feedback at the end of each stage | Moderate to high, feedback each iteration | Low to moderate, mainly at beginning and validation | High, feedback at each increment         | High, especially early for requirements  |
| **Flexibility**    | High, adapts to changes and feedback     | Low, difficult to accommodate changes | Moderate, easier to incorporate changes   | High, can adapt each iteration         | Low to moderate, less flexible          | Moderate, changes made in subsequent increments | High, allows changes based on feedback   |
| **Risk Management**| Continuous risk assessment and mitigation| High risk, issues found later stages  | Better risk management due to feedback    | Risks identified and mitigated early   | Managed by verifying and validating phases | Risks identified and addressed incrementally | Early detection of risks through feedback|
| **Documentation**  | Flexible, often lighter                  | Heavy, detailed documentation         | Heavy, but can incorporate changes        | Moderate, focuses on essential documents | Heavy, detailed documentation for each phase | Moderate, documentation for each increment | Variable, evolves from the prototype     |
| **Use Cases**      | Dynamic projects with changing requirements | Well-defined projects with stable requirements | Complex projects with evolving requirements | Projects needing frequent feedback     | Safety-critical and highly regulated    | Projects developed in stages             | Projects where requirements are unclear  |

### Summary:

1. **Agile:** Ideal for dynamic, evolving projects. It emphasizes flexibility and frequent feedback.
2. **Waterfall:** Best for well-defined projects with stable requirements, following a linear, sequential process.
3. **Iterative Waterfall:** Combines linear stages with feedback loops, allowing some flexibility within a structured framework.
4. **Iterative:** Involves repeated cycles, suitable for projects needing frequent feedback and adaptation.
5. **V-Model:** Emphasizes verification and validation at each phase, ideal for safety-critical and regulated projects.
6. **Incremental Model:** Develops the system in small, functional increments, suitable for projects that can be delivered in stages.
7. **Prototype Model:** Creates a working prototype early to gather and refine requirements, best for projects with initially unclear requirements.
