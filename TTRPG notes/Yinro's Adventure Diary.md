**Backstory**
>Yinro Belelor was born to Valtor and Gwendolyn Belelor, in the bustling city of Lustern. Growing up, Yinro was constantly surrounded by people from all walks of life, and he quickly developed a fascination with the magic that many of them possessed. Despite his mixed heritage, Yinro was able to blend in with both humans and elves alike, and he was always eager to learn more about their respective cultures. As a young boy, Yinro's parents enrolled him in a prestigious academy for magic-users, hoping to nurture his innate talent for spellcasting. Yinro excelled in his studies, quickly mastering the basics of arcane magic and even developing a few unique spells of his own. However, he soon realized that his true passion lay in using magic to help people, rather than simply mastering it for its own sake. Yinro's dedication to his craft caught the eye of a powerful wizard named Lirien, who took the young sorcerer under his wing as his apprentice. Under Lirien's tutelage, Yinro honed his skills and began to experiment with more advanced spells and magical theories. However, Yinro's idyllic life was shattered when Lirien suddenly disappeared, leaving behind only a cryptic message for his apprentice. Determined to uncover the truth behind his mentor's disappearance, Yinro set out on a quest to find him, using his magic to track down any leads he could find. Along his journey, Yinro crossed paths with various individuals who became his companions in his quest. Among them was Kipper, a cheerful halfling bard with a quick wit, Thoren, a rugged dwarven blacksmith with a strong arm and a soft heart, Zara, a secretive tiefling rogue with a sharp mind, and Iounis, a spiritualist with a deep connection to the world around him. Hand of Chains Together, the group discovered a dark and nefarious plot by a group of powerful mages who aimed to overthrow the ruling council of Lustern. While the mages proved to be formidable foes, Yinro's group persevered and ultimately succeeded in stopping the conspirators with the help of Lirien's friend, Xander. Xander, a highly skilled and experienced wizard, also happened to be the headmaster of the academy where Yinro studied. Although Yinro was ultimately unable to find his missing mentor, he emerged from his quest as a stronger and wiser sorcerer, with a newfound sense of purpose and a deep respect for the power of magic. Yinro's group was later divided in two when the party's common goal came to an end. After failing to find his master, Yinro became lost for a while. He sought refuge in the restricted section of the academy's library, delving deep into the study of various forms of magic. It was during this time that he was approached by a mysterious entity, drawn to Yinro's thirst for knowledge and the potential he possessed. The entity, known as the Great Old One, offered Yinro a pact, promising him knowledge beyond his wildest dreams. Desperate to find a way to save his master, Yinro accepted the pact, and in return, gained a portion of the Great Old One's eldritch power. Yinro found himself drawn to the dark and eldritch magic of his new patron, and began studying the ways of the warlock. He soon discovered that his newfound abilities complemented his sorcery, allowing him to tap into even greater sources of power. As he continued to hone his skills as both a sorcerer and warlock, Yinro's ultimate goal remained the same: to find his master and bring him back safely. He knew that he would need all the power he could muster to achieve this goal, and so he delved even deeper into the mysteries of his arcane and eldritch abilities, determined to become the strongest sorlock he could be.
