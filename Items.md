>Forged from the eye of a Catoblepas, this single glove exudes an aura of dark power, imbued with the essence of death itself.

**Death Ray:** With a gesture, you unleash a beam of dark energy from the Catoblepas eye embedded in the glove, striking fear into the hearts of your enemies. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 36 (8d8) necrotic damage, or half as much on a successful save. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target takes 64 necrotic damage and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. ^deathRay
**Deathly Stench:** A foul odor emanates from the glove, filling the air with the scent of decay. Those who dare to approach are met with the overwhelming presence of death. For 1 minute, a 10-foot sphere of putrid air surrounds you. Creatures entering or starting their turn in the area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 1d10 poison damage and are poisoned until the start of their next turn. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not poisoned. ^deathStench

**Breath of Death (Recharge 5-6):** Harnessing the necrotic energy within, you release a cone of deathly power, consuming all in its path with relentless force. You can expel a cone of necrotic energy in a 20-foot cone in front of you. Any creature within the area, except undead, must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 necrotic damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. Undead within the area instead regain 3d10 hit points. ^breathDeath
